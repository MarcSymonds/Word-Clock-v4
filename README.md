# Word-Clock-v4
Version 4 of my Word Clock. Now uses an Arduino and WS2812 RGB LEDs.

My original Word Clock used a PICAXE microcontroller and plain white LEDs to show the time.

This version is a complete redesign and uses and Arduino Nano and WS2812B RGD LEDs to show the time in various colours.

To hold the LEDs, I used Wings3D to create a 11x5 frame to hold 55 LEDs (the clock uses 110 LEDs), and printed that on a 3D printer.
